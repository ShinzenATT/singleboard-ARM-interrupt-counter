#  Interrupt counter test singleboard ARM computer MD-407

Here's a test counter that increments for each interupt in irq0. An irq1 interupt sets the counter to 0 while irq2 toggles the counter between 0 and 0xFF. The interupts are generated by an irq flip flop.

To build any of the projects then the ARM gcc & g++ toolchain is needed along with a way to send
the compiled software to your device such as GDB or by cable. Run `make *.mk` to compile and make the program.

There is also documentation about the MD-407 and the components used with it. The MD-407 and some
components are created by chalmers so some of the documentation is in Swedish. The documents can be
found in the `docs` folder.
